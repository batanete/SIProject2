# SIProject2
 
My second Systems Integration project, from 2016. It consists of a three tier web application implemented in Java.


Data layer: implemented using Java Persistence API.
Business/server layer: implemented using Stateless Enterprise JavaBeans.
Presentation layer: implemented using Java Servlets and HTML(not the focus of the assignment, therefore rather simplistic visually).
